# MyDeepNeuralNetwork

A Deep Neural Network built from scratch.
The model was trained on the MNIST Fashion Dataset.
Project is based on the Book: "Neural Network from Scratch in Python"

## File Descriptions
**MMNLibrary.py**: Contains base functions such as Dense Layers, Activation functions, Loss functions, Accuracy functions, Optimizer functions and an all encompassed Model function.

**train.py**: Trains the model on a preset small architecture([1,256]->[256,256]->[256,10] *Subject to Change*)

**predict.py**: Predicts an input image on a give model

**evaluate.py**: Evaluates a given model on the test set data for MNIST Fashion dataset

**show.py**: Shows the user how the model see the input image in a 28 by 28 pixel grayscaled ratio.
